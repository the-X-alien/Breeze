# Breeze
Imagine a small, 1.5 feet long Airplane model that you can actually fly and do tricks with! And then add the best $9 dollar propeller on there, find a super powerful motor for the same price as the worst ($1.99), and finally, go all in and STRAP A ROCKET MODEL ROCKET ENGINE TO BOTH OF THE WINGS AND IGNITE IT MIDFLIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D
But I guess its not a breeze then, its a STORM!! Well, thats exactly what we did to our from scratch, RC Airplane. Video coming soon !!!!!!!!!! :D
